            You are more likely to achieve your goals if you write them down.  Writing down your goals helps you clarify what you want to achieve in the future, and ensures you are emotionally and intellectually engaged in achieving your goal.
            Writing down your goals doesn’t need to take long, but should form an essential part of your successful morning routine.        
            Taking the time to write down your goals gets you clear on what you want to accomplish each day and builds motivation and momentum.  When you are crystal clear on your goals, you become emotionally engaged in goal achievement.
            Writing down your goals helps you visualise the future you want and clarifies what it would feel like to achieve your goals.
            If you write down your goals, you have a clear picture of where to invest your time and energy each day, which boosts confidence, motivation, and excitement.
